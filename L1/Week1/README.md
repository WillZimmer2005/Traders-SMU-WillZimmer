# Personal Goals Document - Traders@SMU Alpha Program

Level 1 (Junior)

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

While I am a freshman, I do have some relevant background in Quant Finance. I am a finance major and data science minor, both relevant to Quant finance. In high school, I completed AP Calculus BC as well as AP Statistics, two courses which will help me in my career in Quant Finance. I maintain a portfolio of about 15 publicly traded equities, and have conducted relatively thorough fundamental analysis on several companies in my portfolio. I believe I have a relatively good base in my finance skills. While I have not completed any coding projects, I am excited to learn. Finally, my interest in problem solving/analytical skills coupled with my interest in finance and data science naturally led me to become interested in Quant Finance. 

## 2. Career Goals

I hope to go into banking directly after college. I eventually want to build my own companies, and I think that finance (banking in particular) will give me a great technical foundation to make that dream a reality. Like anyone, I want to work for a top bulge bracket or boutique bank out of college. I want to move to a smaller firm after my two years of banking. I want to transition to private equity and then go off on my own, launching startups with my own accumulated capital and SBA loans. In 1 year, I hope to have developed a great base of knowledge, completed my summer internship well, and have an internship lined up for my sophomore and junior summer. In 5 years, I hope to be working at a bank. In 10 years, I hope to be running my own SMB business. 

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

From the Alpha Program, I hope to learn how to use Python effectively. I hope to learn more about pairs trading and hedging in general. I want to learn how to minimize market exposure. I am excited to learn how to use GitHub. I think this program will not only help me develop technical skills in the coding and finance world, but also learn to be more fluent in the language of Quant finance, a useful skill when talking to anyone involved in the field (i.e. interviews, networking opportunities, etc.) This program will set me up well for success in future endeavors (alts, internships, etc.) and I hope I can give back to the program as well as learn from it. 

## 4. Current Technical Skills

My current technical skills are as follows:
Programming languages – Beginner 
-	I don’t have any coding experience 
Data Analysis Tools – Beginner 
-	I have very minimal Data Analysis experience
Statistical Analysis – Intermediate 
-	I have taken a statistics course and think my logical thought process is decent. 
Financial Modeling – Beginner 
-	I have built a model and have been improving, but have a long ways to go 
Machine Learning – Beginner 
-	Never worked w/ ML
Version Control – Beginner 
-	Never worked with Version Controls such as GitHub
Other Relevant Skills: 
Fundamental Analysis/Accounting – Intermediate 
-	I have researched a lot of equities and SMB companies and am relatively proficient in financial accounting. 

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

During this program, I want to learn how to code and analyze data well. I also want to improve my modeling skills. To track my performance, I will ensure I submit all assignments on time and with high quality. Failure to do that will tell me I am off track and need to spend extra time on whatever topic is at hand. I am planning to dedicate between 5-10 hours (on average) per week. Beyond basic program materials, I will use Wall St Prep courses, youtube, and other materials in the resource library. My definition of success for this program is completing the final project with a good understanding of data analytics, a basic understanding of coding, and a good grasp on statistical analysis and financial modeling.
